# Sorting_Algorithms_Improved
An Interactive tool to visualize common sorting Algorithms seen in first year courses at the University of Waterloo. 
The tool is simple to use. Just press the key matching the sorting algorithm you want to visualize and enjoy! Once done, 
press R to randomize the list again so you can explore other sorting algorithms. 
Once the sorting algorithm is complete, the screen will desplay the run-time of the algorithm in Big O notation.
